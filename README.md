# PyPN

PyPN (pronounced like the famous hobbit) is a python library and linear logic theorem prover based on proof nets.

Currently, it supports multiplicative linear logic (MLL) plus the n-ary MIX rule, but it's designed to be fairly hackable for those who want to implement their favourite flavour.

The prover itself works best run inside of a Jupyter notebook. In that case, successful proofs are displayed visually as proof nets with draggable nodes.
